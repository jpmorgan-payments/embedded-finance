# Embedded UI Components

## ðŸš§ Pre-release Version Notice

Embedded UI Components and this guide is currently in draft form and under active development. Components are not ready for production use and may change significantly until version 1.x.x is released. Please consider this document as a work in progress.

### ADA Compliance Disclaimer

While we strive to incorporate ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) best practices, please note that developers are responsible for conducting their own comprehensive ADA testing to ensure full compliance with all applicable standards and regulations.

## Overview

Embedded UI Components offer a seamless way to integrate sophisticated UI components into your existing applications, providing a plug-and-play solution for Embedded Finance features. These components implement complex API capabilities for client onboarding and account linking, simplifying the integration process for developers.

## Important Usage Notes

**All Embedded UI Components must be wrapped within the `EBComponentsProvider`.** The `EBComponentsProvider` is specifically designed for these components and is not applicable to any other client components in your application.

## Setup and Configuration

### EBComponentsProvider

The `EBComponentsProvider` is a crucial wrapper component that must be placed at the top level of your Embedded UI Components implementation. It handles authentication, applies theming, and provides necessary context to all child Embedded UI Components.
It is using @tanstack/react-query for handling API calls and authentication as well as Orval generated types for the API requests and responses.

#### Key Props:

- `apiBaseUrl`: The base URL for API calls (required)
- `theme`: Customization options for the components' appearance (optional)
- `headers`: Custom headers for API requests (optional)

#### Usage:

```jsx
import { EBComponentsProvider } from '@jpmorgan-payments/embedded-finance-components';

const EmbeddedFinanceSection = () => {
  return (
    <EBComponentsProvider
      apiBaseUrl="https://your-api-base-url.com"
      theme={{
        colorScheme: 'light',
        variables: {
          primaryColor: '#007bff',
          fontFamily: 'Arial, sans-serif',
        },
      }}
      headers={{
        'Custom-Header': 'value',
      }}
    >
      {/* Your Embedded UI Components go here */}
    </EBComponentsProvider>
  );
};
```

## Main concepts

The Embedded UI Components are built using a sophisticated approach that leverages OpenAPI Specifications (OAS) and automated code generation to ensure type safety and consistent API integration.

```

### Key Architecture Components

1. **OpenAPI Specification (OAS) & Future Arazzo Flows**

   - OAS defines API contracts and types
   - Source of truth for API interfaces
   - Used to generate TypeScript types and React Query hooks
   - Note: Arazzo Flows and automated flow generation are planned future capabilities - currently no flows are pre-configured

2. **Automated Code Generation**

   - Currently, Orval generates from OAS:
     - TypeScript interfaces
     - Type-safe React Query hooks
     - API client utilities
   - Future capability: Flow generation from Arazzo Flows
   - Ensures type consistency between API and UI

3. **Component Architecture**

   Built using generated types and hooks with an opinionated layer providing:

   - Enhanced client validations based on API specifications
   - Smart payload formation
   - Error mapping & recovery
   - UX optimizations implemented based on best practices:
     - Smart field prepopulation
     - Cognitive load reduction
     - Intelligent navigation

4. **Runtime Flow**
   - Components make API calls to Platform Service Layer (PSL)
   - PSL handles:
     - Authentication & authorization
     - Request forwarding to backend APIs
     - Response processing
     - Error handling

## Main Components

### 1. OnboardingWizardBasic

The `OnboardingWizardBasic` component implements the client onboarding process as described in the [Embedded Payments API documentation](https://developer.payments.jpmorgan.com/docs/embedded-finance-solutions/embedded-payments/how-to/onboard-a-client/onboard).

#### Main Features:

- Create a client profile
- Incrementally update client's related parties
- Complete due diligence questions
- Handle client attestations
- Manage requests for additional documentation
- Check and display onboarding status

#### Usage:

@jpmorgan-payments/embedded-finance-components

```jsx
import {
  EBComponentsProvider,
  OnboardingWizardBasic,
} from '@jpmorgan-payments/embedded-finance-components';

const OnboardingSection = () => {
  const [clientId, setClientId] = useManageClientExternalState();

  const handlePostClientResponse = ({ response, error }) => {
    // Handle client creation response or error
    setClientId(response.id);
  };

  const handlePostClientVerificationsResponse = ({ clientId, error }) => {
    // Handle post client verifications response or error
  };

  return (
    <EBComponentsProvider apiBaseUrl="https://your-api-base-url.com">
      {/* you could use https://api-mock.payments.jpmorgan.com/tsapi/ef/do/v1/ from the API mock server, please find more details at https://developer.payments.jpmorgan.com/api/embedded-finance-solutions/embedded-payments/onboarding#/ */}
      <OnboardingWizardBasic
        title="Client Onboarding"
        initialClientId={clientId}
        onPostClientResponse={handlePostClientResponse}
        onPostClientVerificationResponse={handlePostClientVerificationsResponse}
        availableProducts={['EMBEDDED_PAYMENTS']}
        availableJurisdictions={['US']}
      />
    </EBComponentsProvider>
  );
};
```

OnboardingWizard could also accept products and jurisdictions as optional props to customize the onboarding process.

`availableProducts` determines which products are selectable in the initial step of the onboarding process. If only one product is provided, the component will default to that product and the field will become read-only.

Similarly, `availableJurisdictions` is an array of country codes that are selectable. If only one is provided, it will default to that country.

### 2. LinkedAccountWidget

The `LinkedAccountWidget` component facilitates the process of adding a client's linked account, as described in the [Add Linked Account API documentation](https://developer.payments.jpmorgan.com/docs/embedded-finance-solutions/embedded-payments/how-to/add-linked-account).

#### Main Features:

- Add and manage external linked bank accounts for clients
- Handle complex micro-deposits initiation logic

#### Usage:

```jsx
import {
  EBComponentsProvider,
  LinkedAccountWidget,
} from '@jpmorgan-payments/embedded-finance-components';

const LinkedAccountSection = () => {
  return (
    <EBComponentsProvider apiBaseUrl="https://your-api-base-url.com">
      <LinkedAccountWidget variant="default" />
    </EBComponentsProvider>
  );
};
```

Please refer to the LinkedAccountProps interface in the codebase for more details.

## Theming

The `EBComponentsProvider` accepts a `theme` prop that allows for extensive customization of the components' appearance. The theme object can include the following properties:

- `colorScheme`: 'dark' | 'light' | 'system'
- `variables`: An object containing various theme variables
- `light`: Light theme-specific variables
- `dark`: Dark theme-specific variables

### Theme Design Tokens

Here's an updated table of available theme design tokens that can be used in the `variables`, `light`, and `dark` properties:

```

or

```bash
yarn add @jpmorgan-payments/embedded-finance-components
```

## Contributing

### Recommended VSCode plugins:

- Prettier
- Tailwind CSS Intellisense

### Recommended VS Code Settings

#### `files.associations`

Use the `files.associations` setting to tell VS Code to always open `.css` files in Tailwind CSS mode:

```

"files.associations": {
"\*.css": "tailwindcss"
}

```

#### `editor.quickSuggestions`

By default VS Code will not trigger completions when editing "string" content, for example within JSX attribute values. Updating the `editor.quickSuggestions` setting may improve your experience:

```"editor.quickSuggestions": {
  "strings": "on"
}
```

### Guidelines

1. Create a new component in `./src/core`
2. Export it in `./src/index.tsx`
3. Also add it to `./src/vanilla/componentRegistry.ts`

### Onboarding fieldMap.ts configuration

This configuration file is a mapping utility that connects form fields to API fields. It is designed to handle server errors and create request bodies for API interactions. The configuration is structured as a partyFieldMap object, which defines the mapping rules for various fields related to both organizations and individuals.

#### Key Components

- **Field Mapping**: Each form field is mapped to a corresponding API field using a path. This path indicates where the data should be placed in the API request or where it can be found in the API response.

- **Base Rules**: Each field has a baseRule that defines its default properties, such as visibility and required status. These rules determine whether a field is visible in the form and whether it is mandatory.

- **Conditional Rules**: Some fields have conditionalRules that modify the base rules based on specific conditions, such as the product type or jurisdiction. These rules allow for dynamic adjustments to field properties.

- **Transformation Functions**: Fields that require data transformation between the form and the API use fromResponseFn and toRequestFn functions. These functions handle the conversion of data formats, such as phone numbers.
