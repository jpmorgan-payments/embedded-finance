## 📝 Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **Kept forms in subdirectories**: Forms are complex enough to warrant their own folders
2. **Created separate components directory**: For reusable presentational components
3. **Single custom hook**: Could split further if needed, but current hook is focused
4. **Comprehensive documentation**: Better to over-document than under-document
5. **No breaking changes**: Maintained backward compatibility throughout

### Considerations

- Forms could be further broken down if they grow
- Hook could be split into data + actions if mutations are added
- Components could have their own test files
- Storybook stories could be added for sub-components

### Lessons Learned

- Modular structure makes changes easier
- Documentation is crucial for complex components
- Small, focused files are easier to maintain
- Clear naming conventions help navigation
- Type-first approach catches issues early

## ✨ Summary

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

Successfully restructured LinkedAccountWidget from a monolithic component into a well-organized, modular architecture. All quality checks passed, documentation is comprehensive, and the public API remains unchanged. The component is now easier to maintain, test, and extend.

**Confidence Level**: 🟢 HIGH
