# Linked Account State Machine

This document describes the state transitions for linked bank accounts (recipients) in the Embedded Payments API.

## Status Overview

The following statuses are defined for linked accounts:

- **ACTIVE** - Account is verified and ready for transactions
- **INACTIVE** - Account has been deactivated and cannot be used
- **MICRODEPOSITS_INITIATED** - Microdeposit verification process has started (pending verification)
- **READY_FOR_VALIDATION** - Microdeposits sent, waiting for user to verify amounts (action required)
- **REJECTED** - Account verification failed or was rejected
- **PENDING** - Account information is being processed

## Status Transition Chains

### 1. Instant Verification (Happy Path)

**Chain:** `START → ACTIVE`

**Description:** Account verification succeeds immediately through automated verification. Both account verification and authentication pass on first attempt.

**User Experience:** Account is ready to use immediately after linking.

---

### 2. Microdeposit Verification Success

**Chain:** `START → MICRODEPOSITS_INITIATED → READY_FOR_VALIDATION → ACTIVE`

**Description:** Standard microdeposit verification flow. Two small deposits are sent to the user's bank account. User verifies ownership by entering the exact amounts.

**User Experience:**

1. Account link initiated
2. User waits 3-5 business days for deposits to arrive
3. User enters the two deposit amounts
4. Account becomes active upon successful verification

---

### 3. Microdeposit Verification Failed

**Chain:** `START → MICRODEPOSITS_INITIATED → READY_FOR_VALIDATION → REJECTED`

**Description:** User exhausts all verification attempts (typically 3) by entering incorrect microdeposit amounts.

**User Experience:** User must re-link the account and start verification process over.

---

### 4. Microdeposit Send Failure

**Chain:** `START → MICRODEPOSITS_INITIATED → REJECTED`

**Description:** System unable to send microdeposits to the bank account (e.g., invalid account, bank rejection).

**User Experience:** Immediate failure notification, user must correct account information and retry.

---

### 5. Microdeposit Expiration (Initiated Phase)

**Chain:** `START → MICRODEPOSITS_INITIATED → INACTIVE`

**Description:** Microdeposit process expires before deposits are successfully sent (21-day timeout).

**User Experience:** Account link expires if deposits aren't sent within timeframe.

---

### 6. Microdeposit Expiration (Validation Phase)

**Chain:** `START → MICRODEPOSITS_INITIATED → READY_FOR_VALIDATION → INACTIVE`

**Description:** User doesn't verify microdeposits within 20 business days of deposits being sent.

**User Experience:** Account link expires, user must re-link account to try again.

---

### 7. Split Profile Pending Flow (Success)

**Chain:** `START → PENDING → ACTIVE`

**Description:** Special case where automated verification returns pending status codes. A second verification attempt resolves to active status.

**User Experience:** Brief "processing" state before account becomes active.

---

### 8. Split Profile Pending to Microdeposits

**Chain:** `START → PENDING → MICRODEPOSITS_INITIATED → READY_FOR_VALIDATION → ACTIVE`

**Description:** Initial automated verification returns pending, second attempt requires microdeposit verification.

**User Experience:** Starts as pending, then falls into standard microdeposit flow.

---

### 9. Split Profile Pending to Rejection

**Chain:** `START → PENDING → REJECTED`

**Description:** Initial automated verification returns pending, second attempt fails verification.

**User Experience:** Account temporarily shows as processing, then fails.

---

### 10. Immediate Verification Rejection

**Chain:** `START → REJECTED`

**Description:** Automated verification immediately rejects account due to validation failures (invalid account number, routing number, etc.).

**User Experience:** Immediate failure with error message indicating what needs to be corrected.

---

### 11. Verification Retry Flow (Success)

**Chain:** `START → REJECTED → ACTIVE`

**Description:** Automated verification retry allows retry of verification, which succeeds on second attempt.

**User Experience:** Initial failure, automatic retry succeeds.

---

### 12. Verification Retry to Microdeposits

**Chain:** `START → REJECTED → MICRODEPOSITS_INITIATED → READY_FOR_VALIDATION → ACTIVE`

**Description:** Automated verification retry falls back to microdeposit verification.

**User Experience:** Initial failure, then automatic fallback to microdeposit flow.

---

## Terminal States

**Final Success States:**

- **ACTIVE** - Account fully verified and operational

**Final Failure States:**

- **REJECTED** - Verification failed, cannot be recovered
- **INACTIVE** - Expired or deactivated, requires re-linking

## Important Notes

- **Expiration Window:** Microdeposit verification must be completed within 20 business days from when deposits are sent
- **Max Attempts:** Users have 3 total attempts to verify microdeposit amounts
- **Retry Logic:** Some error conditions allow automatic verification retry
- **PENDING Status:** Used in split profile scenarios where automated verification returns pending codes, requiring a second verification attempt

## Testing These Flows

The workflow stories in this section demonstrate these state transitions:

- **LinkNewAccount** - Default microdeposit flow (MICRODEPOSITS_INITIATED)
- **LinkNewAccountActive** - Instant verification (ACTIVE)
- **LinkNewAccountPending** - Split profile pending flow (PENDING)
- **LinkNewAccountRejected** - Immediate rejection (REJECTED)
- **LinkNewAccountInactive** - Expired/deactivated (INACTIVE)
- **SuccessfulVerification** - Complete microdeposit verification
- **FailedVerification** - Incorrect amounts entered
- **MaxAttemptsExceeded** - All verification attempts used
