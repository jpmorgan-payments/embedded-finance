# How to Calculate Beneficial Ownership

A beneficial owner is any individual who owns **25% or more** of your business. Multiply ownership percentages through each level of the chain.

## Examples

### ✅ Example: Meets 25% Threshold

**Monica Geller (Direct)**

Owns 30% of Central Perk Coffee & Cookies directly

Result: 30% ≥ 25% ✅

---

### ✅ Example: One-Level Chain

**Ross Geller → Central Perk Coffee → Target**

Ross owns 50% of Central Perk Coffee
Central Perk Coffee owns 60% of target

50% × 60% = 30% ≥ 25% ✅

---

### ✅ Example: Two-Level Chain

**Rachel Green → Cookie Co. → Central Perk Cookie → Target**

Rachel owns 80% of Cookie Co.
Cookie Co. owns 50% of Central Perk Cookie
Central Perk Cookie owns 70% of target

80% × 50% × 70% = 28% ≥ 25% ✅

---

### ❌ Example: Doesn't Meet Threshold

**Chandler Bing → Bing Enterprises → Target**

Chandler owns 100% of Bing Enterprises
Bing Enterprises owns 20% of target

100% × 20% = 20% < 25% ❌

---

### ❌ Example: Long Chain Dilution

**Joey Tribbiani → Multiple Companies → Target**

90% → 60% → 50% → 40% chain

90% × 60% × 50% × 40% = 10.8% < 25% ❌

---

## Key Tips

- Multiply percentages through each level (don't add)
- Each additional layer can reduce the final percentage
- If someone owns through multiple paths, add those totals together
- Exactly 25% counts as meeting the requirement

## Common Mistake

❌ Don't add: 50% + 60% = 110%
✅ Multiply: 50% × 60% = 30%
