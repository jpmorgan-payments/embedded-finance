# SampleDashboard Layout and Styling Rule

The [SampleDashboard.tsx](mdc:app/client/src/pages/SampleDashboard.tsx) page uses the following layout and styling conventions:

- **Header:**
  - Built with Mantine's `Paper`, `Group`, `Avatar`, and `Text` components.
  - White background, sticky, subtle shadow, and app branding (logo + name) on the left.
  - Profile, language, and settings controls on the right.

- **Sidebar Navigation:**
  - Uses Mantine's `Paper` and a vertical `Stack`.
  - Each menu item is a Mantine `UnstyledButton` for full control over alignment and spacing.
  - Icon and text are wrapped in a `Group` with `align="center"` and `spacing={8}` for true left alignment.
  - Active item is highlighted with a background color and bold text.
  - The "SellSense Wallet" item uses alert styling: yellow background, border, alert icon, and bold text to indicate action is required.
  - Section labels (e.g., Wallet, Analytics) use Mantine `Text` with uppercase and spacing.

- **Main Content Panel:**
  - The main content area is wrapped in a Mantine `Box` with an outer margin (e.g., `margin: '32px 32px 32px 32px'`) to ensure content does not touch the viewport edges.

- **General:**
  - All layout and styling is handled via Mantine components and the `sx` prop for custom styles.
  - No Tailwind, custom CSS classes, or external style sheets are used for layout or navigation.

Refer to [SampleDashboard.tsx](mdc:app/client/src/pages/SampleDashboard.tsx) for implementation details and further examples.
